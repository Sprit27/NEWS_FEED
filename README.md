# NEWS_FEED
Automated AI News Feed Static Site (CI/CD Optimization):<br>
* Technologies: Python, Google GenAI Client, BeautifulSoup, MongoDB, GitHub Actions, HTML/CSS.
* Created an automated news aggregation site optimized as a static page for efficiency and speed.
* Developed a backend script using BeautifulSoup to scrape news articles from multiple sources.
* Used the Google GenAI Client for advanced classification and segregation of articles into categories, organizing output into a structured JSON format.
* Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to schedule the backend script to run daily (7 AM), automatically updating the JSON data and pushing the changes via a GitHub bot, ensuring the static site remains current.<br>
(Note: Initial deployment used MongoDB Atlas for storage before optimization.)
